Multiple Detail Views in iOS8 using Swift
===================

Apple has a ['Multiple Detail Views'](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MultipleDetailViews/Introduction/Intro.html) sample, but it was last updated in 2012. It was done using Objective C and Xib/Nib files. I have basically tried to replicate the same functionality using Swift and Storyboards.

I am hoping this code can be used as starting point for any new Swift Project where you need multiple detail views.

Here are the advantages/differences over Apple's old sample:

* Swift Code instead of Objective C
* Storyboard instead of Nib
* Universal App instead of just iPad (Thanks to new SplitViewController and showDetailViewController iOS 8 API)

I am not claiming to be an expert and this code may be far from perfect, but I hope it helps a few people. Suggestions, Contributions, Pull Requests are welcome :-)
